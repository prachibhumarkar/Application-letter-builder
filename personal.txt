Dear _______ (recipient’s name)

 

I am sorry for what happened the other night. I know you are angry at me and I deserve your hatred and frustration.  But you do not deserve any of the grief and anger I have caused you.

Words will never fully express how sorry I am, but I truly hope that it is a good start.

 

I regret nothing more in life than what I have done to you; it was totally wrong, stupid and immature of me. I was angry to hear ___________ and without realising I shouted out at you. I can’t bear to see you unhappy because of my actions. When our relationship began, I promised to myself that I would always keep you happy. I failed. I failed both of us.

 

But I want to make amends. I truly do. You’re too important of a person to lose and I hate myself for realizing that now rather than earlier. I understand the gravity of the situation, and I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

 

Please call me ASAP.

 

Waiting eagerly to hear from you.

 

Love always,

 

_________ (Your name)
