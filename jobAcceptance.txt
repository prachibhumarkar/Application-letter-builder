Dear Dexter and Penelope,

It is a great honour and delight to know that you two have decided to tie the nuptial knot. Our heartiest Congratulations to both of you. We gladly accept your invitation to the wedding at Lake Warwick Church, California on Sunday 9th Dec 2011 and to the reception at the Kimberly resort that follows the ceremony.

Thank you also for arranging the hotel for us.

We both look forward to seeing you on 9th December.

Yours truly,

Peter and Hannah Smith
