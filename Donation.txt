Re: $1500 Amount received as Donation

Dear Linda Hamilton:

On behalf of ‘Save the Reef Foundation’ I would like to thank you for your generous donation of $1500 that you sent today. I appreciate your genuine concern towards our initiative. Concerned citizens like you show ‘A true and selfless commitment towards our mission’.

Each year ‘Save the Reef Foundation’ continues to advance its mission of preserving the reef environment which is house to the ‘Endangered Manatees’. The success of the mission can be seen with the increase in the number of Manatees. The coral mass has increased with the conservation of the manatee’s residence. It goes without saying that ‘One effort contributes to multiple benefits’.

Thanks again for your generous support towards our efforts.

Best wishes.

Signature

Mathew Perry
