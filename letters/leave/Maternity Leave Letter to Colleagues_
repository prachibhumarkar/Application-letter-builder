Dear Office mates,

As you all must be aware that I am a ‘Would-be Mother’ and the title is about to materialise into a ‘Full-Fledged Mother’, in a matter of weeks. Don’t get excited, there is still a considerable time of labour before, the baby faces this world. As a health precaution, I will be transferred to the maternity department of the McCoy Hospital, soon. These will be my new quarters and my job is to take care of the baby.

As for my current job and duties, I would like to inform that I will leave no burden behind. I have already completed my share of the work. In my absence the management has already hired a temporary replacement. I have been training her for the past 5 days and she will do the required.  

Before I go on maternity leave, I would just like to thank everyone for the support and understanding you have given me the past few months. I do appreciate all of your well wishes.

Thanks!

See you after a while.
