Subject: 30 days leave

Dear Mr. Chaff,

                        This is to inform you that I am taking leave of absence from 1st October to 30th October 2013 about which we had discussed earlier. I will return to work on 31st October, 2013.

I require these days off due to personal reasons which I cannot disclose to you. Moreover, I have been working very hard for the past few months and I will get the much needed time to relax and revitalise.

Thank you for your consideration.

If you have any questions or issues, please contact me at 088977772 during weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Regards.

Sylvi Romano
