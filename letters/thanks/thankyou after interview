Dear Ms. Doe:

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for interviewing me for the position of Relationship Manager. It was a nice experience for me and I had the opportunity to learn about Lego Toys to a certain extent.

The position of Relationship Manager is not new to me as you would have seen through my Resume. I am basically a very Social Person which makes it easy for me to easily gel with the clients. The education and experience which i have gained over the years are valuable assets not only for me but for your firm also.

I had the opportunity to be interviewed for your firm. That alone is a quite an achievement of sorts. I feel upbeat about the prospect of being involved with a reputed firm as yours. I am at your disposal whenever you feel the need to.

Thank you once again for your time and consideration and I am sure we will meet again.

Sincerely,

Signature

Kevin Nash (typed name)
