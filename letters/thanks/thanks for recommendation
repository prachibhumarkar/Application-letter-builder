Dear Mr. Wilson: 

Thank you so much for recommending me for the Personal Secretary position at Nicrassa Inc. I have got the job and it was your recommendation that did most of the work. My credentials were good but if they weren’t backed by your recommendation, I wouldn’t have got the job. 

I am at the right place, at the right time. I found out that when I got complimented on the third day. I look forward to a fruitful career at Nicrassa Inc.

I can't tell you how much I appreciate your effort and I promise that i will not let your name down but rather make you proud.

Thanks, one again. Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you.

Sincerely,

Samantha Fox.
