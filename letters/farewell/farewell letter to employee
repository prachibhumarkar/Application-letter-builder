Dear Shreya,

It has been 10 years since you joined Gigs Blasphemy Inc. And for these past years you have been a trusted and a valued employee. As a face of our company, your interpersonal skills brought laurels to our company. Your hard work made a lot of difference.

You are a truly valued member of the Gigs Blasphemy Inc, and we all wish you the best in your retirement. It certainly is a loss for us as it is impossible to find an exact replacement. That is what makes you unique and all can say is that have a happy retirement and best wishes for the future. If there is anything I can do for you donâ€™t hesitate to ring me up.

Regards,

Tintin Veils
