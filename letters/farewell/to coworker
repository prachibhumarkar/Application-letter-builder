Dear Martha,

I wanted to inform you that I am leaving my position at Willie Wickie Clothing’s (WWCs). I will be starting a new position at Mark & Masons in two weeks time.

I wanted to let you know that it was good working here and I appreciate having the opportunity to work with you. Thank you for the support, guidance and encouragement you have provided me during my tenure at WWCs. As I leave the company, I am reminded of the experiences and learning’s that I acquired over a period of time. I will miss you and the company; I am looking forward towards my new job and starting a new phase of my career.

Please keep in touch, it is good to have someone like you, it makes life much easier. You can contact me at my personal email address - sam1@gm.com or call me at - 121-91425678

Thanks again for everything.

Yours truly,
