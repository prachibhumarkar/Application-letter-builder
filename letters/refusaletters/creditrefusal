Dear Nawaz Sharif,

This letter is in response to your request made to us about extending you credit card limit to 2000$ has been declined. You have already exceeded your limit of credit and are already being penalised for that with extra interest. Moreover, the deploring state of economy has led us to change our credit policies under which you would have been paying more interest. Yet, we have not levied any interest as per the change in policies.

We had already updated you about these through post and email. We regret reminding you about this information but we need to make ourselves very clear so that there is no misunderstanding.

You have been our valued customer for a long time now, so we can assure you that as soon as our credit policies change, you will be immediately informed. We hope that this does not affect our business relationship in any manner, and that we can continue our mutually beneficial partnership.

Looking forward to a better future.

Sincerely,

Naksood Hirani
