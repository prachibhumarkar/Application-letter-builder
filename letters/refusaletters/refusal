Dear ___________:

                                 It is a great honour and pleasure to receive a job offer from a prestigious organisation such as yours. I am greatly thankful to you and the other members of the organisation for considering me for the position offered.

It is with great regret that I have to inform you that I am unable to accept the offer as I am already committed to various projects for my current employer _________. When I had applied for a position in your company I wasn’t under any contract with any company. Now, I have a binding contract with the current organisation. I am in no position to accept your lucrative offer.

I thank you again for considering me for an opening in your company.

Sincerely,

_______Your Signature
