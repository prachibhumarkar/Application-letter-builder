Dear Mr. Tanveer Khera

I was so sorry to hear about your accident. The moment I heard about it I tried calling you but then I wasnâ€™t sure if you were in a position to do so. I called your family and they told me that you were hospitalised for 2 hours and after that they discharged you.

It is very assuring to know that you have only hairline fracture in your left leg and nothing serious. I was very worried about you and I cannot forget the things that you have done for me. The world needs a good man like you so I pray for your quick recovery and protection from any harm.

You are in my prayers and thoughts.

Get well soon.

Kharvesh Sagoo
