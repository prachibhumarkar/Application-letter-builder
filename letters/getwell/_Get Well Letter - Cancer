Dear Nagoo,
                     I heard about your cancer so the docs say it is stage IV lung cancer. Ooh Scary!!! Yes it is scary but when haven’t we been scared and conquered the fear and got along with our lives. It is not about the stage of the cancer, these technical terms make you fear them even more, don’t they? It is your attitude, your positive mind, your courage and commitment that matters. I know you must be saying “It is easy to say”, I do agree with you, it is easy to say! But how many can say “I have beaten cancer”, very few.  

I am no cancer expert and neither have I met cancer survivors but I do know that it can be beaten and it has been beaten. I am sure you can take inspiration from the links provided below:

I will send you more information and you can get in touch with them. Hear their story, learn from them and make a strategy for yourself. I know that it might feel lonely but there is what that you cannot conquer. Besides I don’t think you are actually alone on this one, you have your parents, your brother, your sister and your cousins, let’s not forget me too.

I may not be physically present with you but my advices, my calls, me emails will always be with you. I would like to come to you but I cannot leave the country before 1 year, you know about immigration rules here. Don’t worry, lesser mortals than you have survived, you are more than them so keep the faith.

Never ever give up.

Peace and Love.

Simon Dundee
