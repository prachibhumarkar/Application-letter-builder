Dear Mr. Apache,

This letter is being written to confirm that as of 21st May 2011, I will no longer require the services of Mackinson Delivery Service. You have been providing your delivery services since the last 2 years and we would have liked to maintain that streak. But unfortunately you do not deliver to India. India is our main client and we wouldn’t risk losing business with them.

It is for that reason and that reason alone, that I had to seek services of another delivery service due to their network in India. I wanted to ensure that I come clear and honest regarding this matter. I am sure we have an understanding and I wish to part on good terms.

My contract agreement with Mackinson Delivery Service for the calendar year expires on 21st May 2011. Please use this letter as our notice not to renew that contract. Please feel free to contact me with any issues regarding this letter.

It has been a pleasure doing business with you.

Best Wishes,

Scott Steiner
