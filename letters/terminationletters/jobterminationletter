Dear Mathews:

It is a great regret that I have to inform you that your employment agreement with Nickard Intel Limited as of 12th November, 2010 stands terminated as of today on account of the following reasons:

Substandard Work â€“ After reaching an agreement with the 5 superiors of the department in which you worked and Three Warnings given to you for your poor performance, it has been determined that your work quality does not meet the standards of our company.

If you are not satisfied with our decision you are free to have a legal aid as per your employment rights. But considering the thoroughness of our employment experts in this matter, you can only expect a similar outcome. But it is entirely up to you, our responsibility is to fully inform you about all the aspects related to the termination.

I would like to clarify that this is a purely professional mutual decision. The severance package and the full and final settlement of any outstanding benefits can be discussed with the HR, Mr Harish Sharma. At the same time, you are requested to hand in any company property given to you on account of company work.

Please do inform us if you need any information or have any doubts.

Best Wishes,

Nick Nolte

Unit Manager
