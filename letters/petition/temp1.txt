Dear ________,

I write you with great reluctance and a heavy heart. I am not at ease with such dealings but what has to be done, has to be done! It is about one of our co-employee _________ who is employed as a quality analyst in the ______________. He has been an employee for this company for about ___________. The petition against him is that he is very _________and _________. Being a senior in terms of service period, he throws his weight around especially on newly employed candidates. I and other employees have same designation, authority and pay scale. It is only on experience that he scores over us. But even then he has no authority to treat us like this. I and other 12 new employees have to consistently face his irrational behaviour. He doesn’t have the manners to talk with women and lacks work etiquettes.

I have summarised the count of his abusive behaviour on employee to employee basis for your ease.

Below is a partial list of statements of those affected.

1. On ___________, I made some minor mistakes and I was called upon by ________. He shouted at me in front of all employees and insulted me. It has been only _______ since I joined the firm and I didn’t deserve such harsh treatment for my mistakes.

Signed: ________

2. On ___________, Mr. Chad made some discriminatory remarks on my religion. I am ________ and he called me ___________. When I objected he threatened to use his influence to get me fired. I was taunted the whole day, it was only that the office closed that I had a sigh of relief.

Signed: ______________

3. On ___________, Mr. Chad commented on my face which was totally unrequited. I have lots of pimples on my face due to a medical condition. Without any regard towards my condition, he addressed me as _________. I was so overcome by his comments that I just couldn’t revert back. What kind of office is this, where you get away by saying anything you feel like?

Signed: _________

4. On ______________, I joined office after 3 days of viral fever. As per policy, I was supposed to inform verbally or in written for my absence, which I did. Yet, I was pointed out in the staff meeting about being absent from work. What wrong did I do? Aren’t you supposed to take medical leave if you are sick?

Signed: ___________

I spoke to him personally about his behaviour, but his attitude was dismissive. Though, he has been a loyal employee of the company, such kind of behaviour is unacceptable for the high standards of our company. I suggest that he receive a formal letter from the Human Resources department, regarding his weird behaviour. Please consult him personally and find out if he is suffering from any personal issue. I am of the opinion that he should receive psychiatric treatment or anything which is feasible. I am hopeful a prompt action would be taken otherwise it is hard for me and other employees to continue with this job.

I am enclosing signed statements from the affected employees for your reference.

Yours Sincerely,
