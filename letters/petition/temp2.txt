Dear ________ / To whom it may concern

I am writing to appeal my academic dismissal from ________. I was supposed to appear for ___________examination on ___________ and ____________ on _________, 2012 for the_______ semester. However, I could not appear for the examinations as I was suffering from ___________ during this period. I was hospitalised for _______ at the ____________. I was in no condition to appear for the examinations. I intimated the university about this through a written document.

As per college laws I am entitled to appear for these two papers whenever I have been certified Healthy by the medical examiner. I sent the application for appearing in these exams along with medical certificate of fitness. However, I got no intimations in this regard. When I contacted the examination department about this they said I didn’t need to appear as I have been dismissed from the institute. I was shocked and felt confused and mental anguish as it is not my fault.

Please take appropriate action and inform me. I have followed the rules and regulations towards this end and I deserve the right to appear for the remaining two examinations.

I have enclosed copies of Intimation of Absence, University Examination Schedule, Medical Prescriptions, Treatment Record and Medical Certificate for your reference.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

__________ Your Signature
