Dear ______,

                        I write this letter to announce my formal retirement from Rabble Dabble Entertainment Inc. as Marketing Head, effective as of March 21st 2013. The date corresponds to the clause in the contract under which the maximum age of employment is 45.

I have been employed with the incorporation since 2002 and I have learned and experienced a lot. Such an opportunity wouldn’t have been possible in any other firm. I am honoured and thankful to the firm, yourself and all those who have supported me all these years. The interaction with clients and co-workers sharpened my social skills even more and the lesson of teamwork has been absorbed in my mind well enough. It has been a satisfying journey and I cherish the moments of glory.

That being said I am still available for any support required under any capacity as I would like to be associated with the firm.

Please let me know if I can be of any assistance during this transition.

Thanking You.

Sincerely,

_________ Your Name
