Dear ________,

This is to inform you that the __________ purchased by us ______ ago do not work properly. Most of them ____________ and some of them ___________.

As per the warranty and replacement policy we are entitled to have replacement within __year of the purchase without any extra cost, if and when any problem occurs. We would have suffered a major loss if we didn’t have some spare__________. Fortunately we did have them but they required some fine tuning. However, we are not charging anything for the time and effort required to do so.

But we do need the replacements ASAP. And that is what the purpose of this letter is. You can even pay for the replacements only by cheque or online transfer. I am also requesting reimbursement for the shipping charges for returning the original order to you.

I have enclosed copies of purchase order, warranty and shipping charges for your reference.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to call me or e-mail me at ________.

I expect we can settle this matter in a timely and cooperative manner.

Signed,
