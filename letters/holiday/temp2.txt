Dear Family and Friends / Rodriguez

Happy Holidays to you! I/We hope the past year has brought you many blessings.

This is to inform you that I/we are back from our thrilling vacation to Malaysia. Even though we have come back our souls are still there. Everything here looks and feels different even though this is our home. Kuala Lampur, the capital city is so clean and high tech for an Asian country. I/We cannot forget Genting Highlands which is a hill resort. It is situated on a mountain peak and there are many hotels, restaurants and theme parks. My/Our favourite was SnowWorld theme park.

Let’s not forget “The Petronas Towers” or “Petronas Twin Towers” the tallest twin building in the world.

Dolphin show, sea lion show and cobra show were just so exhilarating.

As for Food there was everything that a non-vegetarian could ask for. Not much choice for vegetarians though.

We did not much shopping though but yes saw some good reasonably priced stuff. I would really recommend Kuala Lampur and Genting Highlands as a must go and see place.

That’s all for now, more for later!

Also, I/We am/are back at work and available whenever you need to contact me/us again.

Take care

Happy Holidays,

The Sekhon Family / John Robin (Your Name)
