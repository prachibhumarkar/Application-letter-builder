Dear Mr. Tailon:


People for Animals (PFA) seeks support of $ 6,000 from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) for medicines, food items, maintenance, project support, publications support etc. for our ongoing ‘Dog Sterilisation Campaign’.

We are grateful for the support we received from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in the year 2000 for ‘Save the Sparrows Campaign’ and PFA considers the ‘Dog Sterilisation Campaign’ may be of comparable interest to your foundation. As conservation supporter all over the world, the campaign is very much aligned with IFAW’s consistent mission in preserving and saving the natural world through education, project funding, preventing poaching by generating jobs for those dependent on forests and many other which deserve a credible applause.

PFA was established in 1997 and has been actively promoting welfare activities for animals in almost all states of India.

Some of our activities include:

Sterilisation
Rehabilitation
Endangered Animal Protection and Breeding
Treatment of Sick and Injured Animals
Organising Awareness Campaigns
Animal Shelter
Animal Hospital
Some of our Achievements

Number 1 NGO for Animals in India 2011
Recognition from WSPCA for outstanding achievement 2009, 2010
3rd Popular Animal Welfare Organisation in Asia (wildlife weekly 2010)
The campaign for which we request funds will benefit both the Dogs and People of Tricity - Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula.

Benefits

Prevention of increase in Dog Bites among the residents of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula
Control of booming Dog population
Decrease in cruelty towards Dogs
Maintain harmony among humans and dogs
Maintaining a proper record of dog population
Dog behaviour awareness through school visits, college visits and community through various audio-visual means
The campaign has been projected for a span of 3 years and requires 50,000$ to fully achieve the above mentioned benefits. We are short of exactly 18,000$ for which we have requested other organisations. While we expect 6,000$ from your side but would be highly obliged if granted the whole amount.

We invite you to visit our office or call us at 7442000, 9324329 between 8AM to 5 PM within a week from the receiving date of this letter. We will arrange for your visit, stay and food without any charges. We will be glad to submit a full proposal with additional information for your further review.

Thanking you.

Sincerely,

Maenka Mishra
